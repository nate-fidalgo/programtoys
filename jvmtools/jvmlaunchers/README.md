A Directory to hold neat ways to run java programs and booting jvm's 
Remember alot of these programs depend on you having the jni header files and libraries in your path when compiling.
So you will need the JDK installed i used version 22 however nothing to different from standard 1.5 code from way back in day.
So it will probably work with very old legacy JDK as well!
Also you probably will need visual studio as well or at least the SDK for the windows api with your IDE of choice.

Assuming if you can read/understand the code then you pretty much know how to go about setting it up to build in your
enviorment.
